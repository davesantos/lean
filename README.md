##Lean

A true bare bones Wordpress theme that employs [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) & [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

Spend more time creating & less time scrapping infrastructures. This project is aimed towards developers who do not need their hands held through the course of making a Wordpress theme, so you will not find an excessive amount of commented lines.

###What's different?
There are many starter themes out there. Lean takes the minimal requirements of a fully functional Wordpress theme. If it's not necessary, it's not there.

__No proprietary functions.__
Too many dependancies on *functions.php* can get messy. Although there are a few clean-up scripts. There is no excess of premade functions associated with the *Lean* project. Make a project truly your own the way you're used to doing it.

__No over-simplications on the surface__
Use on a per-projects basis. Reusable systems are helpful but should be implemented only for when it is needed.

###License
The project is under the MIT License.
