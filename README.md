##Lean

A true bare bones Wordpress theme that is ready with [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) & [Susy](http://susy.oddbird.net/) for [Compass](http://compass-style.org/).

Spend more time creating & less time scrapping infrastructures. This project is aimed towards developers who do not need their hands held through the course of making a Wordpress theme, so you will not find an excessive amount of commented lines.
